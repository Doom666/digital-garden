title: neural nature of humans
---


We tend to believe that we are programmable, just as computers are.
But our brains are not based on CPU cores, we are a Gigantic neural network that is so powerful that can create a whole reality experience within it.
Therefore we cannot expect to behave like a CPU. Instead, we can expect to behave like any other neural based animal.
this means that we do not program ourselves, we domesticate ourselves at will.
