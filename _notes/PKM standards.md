title: PKM standards
date: 4-5-2021

When defining the standards of my digital garden, is very important, at least to me, to have [[my PKM goal]] in mind, so they contribute to that goal. 
Here are some of my ideas for it:
- Note names shall be descriptive
- Notes starts with lowercase letters.
- Tags are only for status and to describe what type of object the note refers to. Here is some [[tag reference]]
- I have to still clarify how will I use the categories. More information on [[tags vs notes in my PKM]]
- B/A stands from Before and After notes. This comes from the original Zettlekasten method as Lumann would set each note before and after another note. This forces me to recall other notes I have in this Vault.
- No redundant or pointless linking.

## Things to consider:

This is not my personal vault, so I do not journal here.
This is not the Wikipedia, The Wikipedia shares the common knowledge of mankind, this digital garden is about My personal point of view, thoughts I have Matured, my take on concepts, my vision, my theories, and understandings of the world.
