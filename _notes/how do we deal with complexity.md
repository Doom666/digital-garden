title: how do we deal with complexity
---

The world is a complex mess of problems. No day goes by without facing a difficulty of any sort. This is a problem that biology has taken a great deal of effort into helping us solve. For example, we have a lot of biases, each of which helps us determine a preference of action, that at some point of evolution has proven to keep us alive and thriving.

One of the ways we go about dealing with our complex lives is by learning as much as we can from each other’s solutions to problems. When we talk about learning, the first thing that pops into mind is studies and school, but in truth, learning is something we do instinctively all the time. We, for example, learn the fears of our parents when we are kids, after all, if “the almighty thing that keeps you alive” is afraid of something, you better be sure you hide well from it. It does'nt end there, we learn also other people’s values, beliefs, and processes.
