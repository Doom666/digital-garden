title: we have the tendency to abstract everything
---

Mankind creates abstractions from everything he experiences.
By abstracting, I mean the act of juxtaposing information into an object, oftentimes metaphysical in nature.
For example, our brains adds value to things. This "value" is metaphysical information that we perceive. Is an abstract thought.
Things do not end there, we abstract pretty much anything we come in contact with:

Food - Gastronomy.
other people - psychology.
Ourselves - Identity.
Sex - Porn.
Behavior - Ethics.
Groups of individuals - Morals.
Happenings -History.
Pleasure/pain - Good and Evil.
Relationships - Friends and enemies.
Sensations in our body that moves us or stops us from doing things - [[Emotions]]
	
The list goes on, tree - furniture, stone - jewelry and so on...

The implications of this are that we do not discern reality from abstraction as well as we believe. We don't see a mammal from the hominid family, we see an identity, a narrative, a personality, a past staring back on us.

The problem with this is that then, we treat ourselves as an identity, a narrative, a personality and a past, not what we truly are, an animal. 

It is my dream to develop the repercussions of this miss match effect in humans in a work called "The Human Condition Framework".
