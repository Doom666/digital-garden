# About 

## The site
This website is what is known as a *digital garden*. This name is a bit too sissy for me, so I called *Thought Matrix*, just because *brutal core of infernal thinking about everything that will cease to exist* was a bit too much.
Jokes apart, I want to build in public, and this is my effort to open up my thinking to the world.

Also, A digital garden works like a Wikipedia but is your thought, your knowledge what is being expressed. The act of creating and managing a database of your knowledge is called PKM "Personal Knowledge Management," which is a rabbit hole that will enrich your life.

## The author
That would be me, a life empowerment coach and black metal musician.
I work as an empowerment coach as a solopreneur of Mindwork/s. Mindowrk/s is not only my company but my vision and ticket to an empowered life. I will not stop at being a 1 to 1 coach. I want to create an organization of brilliant minds that studies the human condition, creating a whole new standard for mental well-being without conflict of interest. The fact that we as a species still face problems such as suicide, abuse, and addiction, to name some, is a clear sign that *there is something **crucial** we still do not understand* about human nature. If we would as much as we proudly pretend, we wouldn't face that problem. 

I want to work on creating models that explain the human condition and serve as a tool to understand our existential nature and to develop solutions to the tremendous human confusion.
 I also believe that what Elon Musk does with technology can be done to mental health, well-being and the common knowledge about ourselves. It must happen soon.

Since I have the vision, that is the place I will be going. This website is where I will be "cooking" the knowledge I will be basing my products and projects on.
